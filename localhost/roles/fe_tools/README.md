# Install front-end tools

Install host front-end tools for running processes locally for those who want
to.  Running grunt/gulp on the host performs better than in VM.

## Variables

- `fe_tools_brew`: tools to be installed with `homebrew`
- `fe_tools_npm`: tools to be installed with `npm`

See `defaults/main.yml` for the current default values (safer than duplicating the list here).
